# FrontEnd-FP-Crypto-Dashboard
#(Travis) Initial project built with visual studio blank react app, in addition to this. Redux toolkit was used to allow javascript routing to the API "Coinranking". Without this toolkit working with a crypto api is impossible, as CORS errors are thrown to stop the api call from a javascript file. (Speculating: I believe this is for security, as allowing a javascript files to request info from could present some vulnerability for the API)

#(Rajat) Due to an issue with Github, I used the node_modules folder from a new React app created with create-react-app. 
#API KEY for CoinMarketCap: fec80d9c-4bc0-4a57-8d15-4df70cbe9ea9.
#Required for Dashboard.js: axios
